        "story": "I have known Praveen for some time without ever using his services as I have a trusted artist I use in Thailand but as I have 1.5 years left on my visa in India and wanted a Ganesha tattoo I decided where better than India itself so discussed designs and agreed a reasonable price. His studio is spotless, his equipment all brand new and his skill unquestionable. Because I was leaving station the next day he and his assistant worked for a solid 10 hours on my back and i am totally 100% pleases with the result. I'll finish by saying, if you are in Palolem, South Goa or anywhere near and want a tattoo, you will not find better",

        "story": "After a lot of research I made a decision to get my tattoo done by Praveen and his team of artistes. And I was right. I never imagined getting a tattoo would be such a nice and painless experience. It was my first tattoo and I went for 2 at a time and I am really happy with how my tattoo looks now. He is available for any questions you have after getting inked. I followed everything told by him and the results were great. I will get my next tattoo from him when I visit Goa (Palolem) the next time. Thank you so much ðŸ˜Š I convinced my husband to get one and he is happy too.",
